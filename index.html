  <div class="about">
    <p>Hello! I am a graduate student at the University of Missouri studying photojournalism. I graduated in December 2021 with a bachelors degree in Convergence Journalism and Political Science.</p>
    <p>I currently work as the Assistant Director of Photohraphy at the Columbia Missourian. I manage the day-to-day operations of the photo department, working with photographers, photo editors, reporters, designers and graphics producers.</p>
    <p>I initially went to school to study multimedia production and fell in love with photojournalism while I was working as a staff photographer and eventually photo editor at the Columbia Missourian.</p>
    <p>Outside of photojournalism, I love to read and hike. I am currently reading "Where the Crawdads Sing" and my favorite place to hike is Shenandoa National Park.</p>
    <p>You can reach me at <a href="mailto:mmww2z@umsystem.edu">mmww2z@umsystem.edu</a></p>
